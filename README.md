# Detecting-Neutrinos-with-MET
rootAnalyzer.C is worked up to pp collisions with neutrinos and only reading and comparing gen and reco of one file.

rootAnalyzerEdited.C is comparing and graphing files containing 10k events of pp collisons with and without neutrinos. Calculating the misisng mommentum of the neutrinos and comparing Gen and Reco to determine if CMS is being efficient. We're seeing Reco outdo gen's Pt with the file containing neutrinos and data is indiciating we may not be detecting neutrinos with a charge of 0.
